# Panic-Button-V2
This is a chrome extension that does a simple thing when clicked on its icon removes the history and all the working tabs in your browser. Pin it and click it and it clears the history and all tabs. Its disguised as a note extension for obvious reasons



#For V1 that only removes history and doesnt clear the tabs refer to repo below
