# Panic-Button-V2
This is a chrome extension that does a simple thing when clicked on its icon removes the history and all the working tabs in your browser. Pin it and click it and it clears the history and all tabs. Its disguised as a note extension for obvious reasons.

Also* i would like to mention that use this at your own risk as if you remove the tabs for panic mode there is no way (yet) to retrive them i might add such feature in future but not now , so just to keep you on safe side use the v1 if you got get into such intense panic modes that you have to use v2..



# For V1 that only removes history and doesnt clear the tabs refer to repo below
